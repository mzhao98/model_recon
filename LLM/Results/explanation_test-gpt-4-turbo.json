The first step involves identifying the dishes on the counter to determine which items need to be loaded into the dishwasher. Next, the dishwasher is opened to allow for the loading of dishes. After the dishes are loaded, soap must be added to ensure the dishes are cleaned properly. The dishwasher is then closed to secure the dishes and soap inside, and finally, the dishwasher is started to begin the cleaning process. This sequence covers all necessary steps to assist in doing the dishes using the available actions. No additional actions are needed for this specific task."
