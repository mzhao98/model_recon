I believe that this is because water from the fridge is filtered and you preffer filtered water.\n\n**Target Domain: load_dishes**\n\nYour task: \nThe robot must assist the human in doing the dishes. \n\nHuman question:\nWhy did you load a clean plate into the dishwasher?\n\nIn your response, strictly adher to this format:\n`All Facts: [list the relevant facts, each labeled either as `(public)`, `(private-robot)`, or `(private-human)`]`\n`Facts to Communicate: [list the `(private-robot)` or `(private-human)` facts that need to be communicated to address the human question]`\n`Explanation: Provide an explanation to the human using the list of facts that need to be communicated. Do not promise future changes to behavior.`"

I understand that you can usually tell by looking whether a plate is clean or dirty and do not expect clean dishes to be washed again."
