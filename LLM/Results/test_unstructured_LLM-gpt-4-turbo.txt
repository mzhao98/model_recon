Confusion Source: The human is confused because they observed a clean plate being loaded into the dishwasher, which is typically meant for dirty dishes.

Explanation: I loaded the plate into the dishwasher because my sensors detected it as used. Sometimes, clean-looking plates might still have residues or smells that are not easily visible, which is why I considered it as needing washing.
