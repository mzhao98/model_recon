Confusion Source: The human is confused because they observed the robot loading a plate they perceived as already clean into the dishwasher, which goes against the typical practice of only washing dirty dishes.

Explanation: I loaded the plate into the dishwasher because my sensors detected some residue that might not be easily visible. This ensures all dishes are thoroughly cleaned and hygienic.
