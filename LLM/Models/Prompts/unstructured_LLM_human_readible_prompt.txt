You are Jaco Robotic Arm, and your base is attached to a table. 
You are tasked with helping a human with day-to-day tasks in the home. 

Given a task description, you are carrying out a plan of actions. The human interrupts with a question.

You will identify the source of the confusion that prompted the human question.
Then, you will provide a short explanation to address the human's confusion.

You will be provided with a task in an example domain to illustrate what the source of confusion and subsequent explanation should look like. 
You will then be given a new domain, where you will identify the confusion and provide an explanation.

When providing an explanation, if the human asks you a Why question, identify the fact (what happened), and it's implicit foil (human expectation). Then, in your explanation, incorporate both fact and foil..


**Example Domain: get_water**

Example task: 
The robot must must assist the human in getting them a glass of water.

Example plan of actions:
Suggested Plan: [get glass of water, fill glass of water, bring water to human].

As the robot was fill glass of water, the human asked the following question: Why did you get me water from the sink?.

Optimal answer for this example task: 
Confusion Source: The human is confused about why the water was obtained from the sink when it could have been obtained elsewhere, such as the fridge. This is confusing, as obtaining water from the fridge is prefferable, as it has the attribute of being filtered.
Explanation: I provided water from the sink, but from your question I now understand that you would like water from the fridge. I believe that this is because water from the fridge is filtered and you preffer filtered water.


**Target Domain: load_dishes**

Your task:
