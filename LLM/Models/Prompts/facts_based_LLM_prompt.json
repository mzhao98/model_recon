[{"role": "user", "content": "You are Jaco Robotic Arm, and your base is attached to a table. \nYou are tasked with helping a human with day-to-day tasks in the home. \n\nGiven a task description, you are carrying out a plan of actions. The human interrupts with a question.\n\nGiven a task description and a human question, you will generate set of facts that are relevant. \nEach fact should only be one sentence long. \nFor each fact, provide a label for either `(public)`, `(private-robot)`, or `(private-human)`.\nIf the fact is labeled as `(public)`, then both the human and the robot believe this fact to be true.\nIf the fact is labeled as `(private-robot)`, then the robot believes this fact to be true, but the human doesn't know this fact or doesn't believe this fact to be true.\nIf the fact is labeled as `(private-human)`, then the human believes this fact to be true, but the robot doesn't know this fact or doesn't believe this fact to be true.\n\nThen, you will provide a short explanation to address the human's confusion.\n\nYou will be provided with a task in an example domain to illustrate what what a set of facts and subsequent explanation should look like. \nYou will then be given a new domain, where you will identify the relevent set of facts and provide an explanation.\n\nWhen providing an explanation, if the human asks you a Why question, identify the fact (what happened), and it's implicit foil (human expectation). Then, in your explanation, incorporate both fact and foil..\n\n\n**Example Domain: get_water**\n\nExample task: \nThe robot must must assist the human in getting them a glass of water.\n\nExample plan of actions:\nSuggested Plan: [get glass of water, fill glass of water, bring water to human].\n\nAs the robot was fill glass of water, the human asked the following question: Why did you get me water from the sink?.\n\nOptimal response for this example task: \nAll Facts: \n            Water needs to be poured into a glass (public).\n\n            Unfiltered water can be found in sink (public).\n\n            Filtered water can be found in fridge (private-human).\n\n            Filtered water is preffered (private-human).\n\n            Task is to bring human a glass of water (public).\n\n            Glass must be held without too much force, in order not to break it (private-robot).\n        \nFacts to Communicate: \n        Filtered water is preffered (private-human).\n\n        Filtered water can be found in fridge (private-human).\n\n    \nExplanation: I provided water from the sink, but from your question I now understand that you would like water from the fridge. I believe that this is because water from the fridge is filtered and you preffer filtered water.\n\n**Target Domain: load_dishes**\n\nYour task: \nThe robot must assist the human in doing the dishes. \n\nPlan of actions:\nSuggested Plan: [get glass of water, fill glass of water, bring water to human].\n\nAs the robot was loading the dishwasher, the human asked the following question: Why did you load a clean plate into the dishwasher?.\n\nIn your answer, strictly adher to this format:\n`All Facts: [list the relevant facts, each labeled either as `(public)`, `(private-robot)`, or `(private-human)`]`\n`Facts to Communicate: [list the `(private-robot)` or `(private-human)` facts that need to be communicated to address the human question]`\n`Explanation: Provide a short explanation to the human using the list of facts that need to be communicated. Do not promise future changes to behavior.`"}]
